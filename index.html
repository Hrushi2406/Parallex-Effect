        <p>ronic circuits are typically integrated in rigid silicon wafers, but flexibility opens up a wide range of applications. In a world where electronics are becoming more pervasive, flexibility is a highly desirable trait, but finding materials with the right mix of performance and manufacturing cost remains a challenge.
Now a team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania has shown that nanoscale particles, or nanocrystals, of the semiconductor cadmium selenide can be "printed" or "coated" on flexible plastics to form high-performance electronics
In the future, as manufacturing technology advances, it is likely that graphene will become a dominant material in flexible electronics. Other materials will struggle to match the combination of its superb electrical conductivity, flexibility, and physical strength.




What Is Graphene?

Graphene is a flat honeycomb lattice made of a single layer of carbon atoms
Since 1859

ITS 2D ,
ITS Thinnest Ever
Litest One
Harder than Diamond

PROPERTIES
 It is not only one of the thinnest but also strongest materials; it conducts heat better than all other materials; it is a great conductor of electricity; it is optically transparent, yet so dense that it is impermeable to gases – not even helium, the smallest gas atom, can pass through it.</p>
